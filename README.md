I ran tests on all functions until they had all passed. (2 hrs)

## Week 10
### 1. 16/11/2020- I worked on fixing the tests from jasmine(I made the tests correctly run randomized). I added getUserCallback() which now retrieves a user via observer in order to fix an error with enableTutorOptions(). Two tests( for setUpUserDoc & setUpTutorDoc) still give issues but the functions work when ran from the web page. I added the relevant sources to the service worker and merged the work Dharian and I had done. I uploaded the app as version-0.3.4-Jose to Github.
